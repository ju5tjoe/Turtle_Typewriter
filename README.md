# Turtle_Typewriter

While I am reading and learning "through" the Think Python Book (online here: https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/) I came across the excersise to build a typewriter with and through the turtle module of python. 
>> **Chapter 4, Excercise 4.4.**

I am currently in the phase where I did a few tutorials (codecademy pro and a 1 week course at Freie University Berlin for Python programming and data analysis) and think I know enough to start and work and learn through applied excercises. Or to put it differently: I have to learn through applied excercises or I won't get anywhere with this. 

I thought I'd give it a go and just try and see where it would lead me. 
I did not use help for this project and did not check the provided link in the book to get me startet. Currently (Mai 2020) I am almost done with two versions which I set out to do. 
Version 01: A script, that will simply allow me to write all the letters of the alphabet. 
Version 02: A more sophisticated version that will have cleaner code blocks and higher user friendlyness. 

I use atom text editor to write the script and then run it from the command line.
